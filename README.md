This repository contains problems used in the [Lean Online Judge](https://leanoj.org).

### Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome! If you want to suggest a problem, please, follow the guidelines: 
- Suggest a single problem per pull request;
- Provide a title, statement, and, if applicable, a link to the source in the comment to the pull request;
- Check other files for examples, apply basic formatting (e.g. spaces, line lengths), try to keep imports light (e.g. do not import the whole `Mathlib`);
- If you also have a solution, consider submitting it to [`xyzzy`](https://leanoj.org/index.php?action=view_problem&id=25) and provide a link to the submission in the comment to the pull request.

In general, the current goal is to collect problems that can be attempted by users with little experience in Lean. Therefore, problems with relatively short solutions are preferred.
